# Reason
- Bored. Broken PC to come into my life, by a friend called H. Will work on more, should help me set things up faster in accordance to my arch-script.
- Most DE/WM uses Xorg and its utils, so I wanted something special for myself. But I will have to build it by my own.
- Ideals somewhat align with the suckless devs.
## Updates
- I should be updating my `man` page at [`dwn.1`](https://github.com/SaxoCatto/dwm-rice/blob/main/dwm.1).
- Some documentation might call <kbd>Winkey</kbd> as <kbd>Super</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd> as <kbd>Return</kbd>. Also for dwm, <kbd>LeftAlt</kbd> as <kbd>Mod4</kbd>, <kbd>Super</kbd> as <kbd>Mod1</kbd>.
- Stay tuned for my script + config for Hyprland environment.
# Dwm, Dwmblocks and more
- I like Hyprland too. But sometimes it borks itself for faulty theme installs. So rip.
- Make your own environment with this. DE is abit bloated. WM is cool, but they all feel the same. Dwm is no exception. 
## Scratch pad
- Yeah.
## Installation
- Dwm, Dwmblocks must be installed correctly.
```
make # in dwm/dwmblock directory
sudo make clean install # check the cli output 
```
- Tinker should be done in [`config.h`]().
## How to use
- Use the RTFM formula.

# Features
- Yea
