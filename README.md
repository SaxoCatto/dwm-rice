# Reason
Bored. Perfect timing for a broken PC to come into my life. Will work on more, should help me set things up faster in accordance to my arch-script.

## Updates
- I should be updating my `man` page at [`dwn.1`](https://github.com/SaxoCatto/dwm-rice/blob/main/dwm.1).
- 
# Dwm, Dwmblocks
- I like Hyprland too. But sometimes it borks itself for faulty theme installs. So rip.
- Make your own GUI with this. I forgot some of the patches that I use so have some.

## Installation
- Dwm, Dwmblocks must be installed correctly. Try RTFM and tinker with make 


## How to use
- Use the RTFM formula.

# Patches
- Patch: patch -i ./path/to/patch.diff
- Patches[`statuscmd`](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/),
